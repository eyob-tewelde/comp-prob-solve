### Isothermal Expansion vs Adiabatic Expansion

The work done on an ideal gas during an isothermal expansion is **greater** in magnitude than the work done during an adiabatic expansion for the same volume change. This is the result of the difference in surroundings between the two expansions. During both expansions, the gas is expanding, so the gas must expend energy. However, in an isothermal expansion, the gas is exchanging heat with its surroundings, so the expended energy is immediatly balanced by the surroundings. During an adiabatic expansion, the gas is not exchanging heat with its surroundings, so its decrease in temperature remains. As the difference between the intial and final volume increases (the gas expands further and further), the gas undergoing isothermal expansion will have increasingly more energy than the gas undergoing adiabatic expansion. This is why the magnitude of the work done on an ideal gas during an isothermal expansion is greater than the work done during an diabatic expansion for the same volume change.
