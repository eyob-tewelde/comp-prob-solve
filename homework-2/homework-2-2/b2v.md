# How the shape of a pair-wise interaction potential affects the second virial coefficient

> The shape of the pair-wise interaction potential affects how calculation of second virial coefficient as a function of temperature.

>The hard-sphere model for the interaction potential is flat and large over the range of the problem. Since the temperature is multiplied by the boltzmann constant, increments in temperature are very small compared the potential factor. As a result, the B2Vs appear to remain constant.

>The square-well model for the interaction potential is flat but not always large over the range of the problem. From σ to λσ, the square well potential is less than the hard sphere. I probably calculated the B2V for the square well incorrect since it should be equal to the hard sphere model at distances greater than λσ.

>The lennard-jones potential is curved from σ to λσ. It decreases until it reaches a minimum and then begins to increase again until it eventually approaches the hard sphere approximation. I probably calculated this incorrectly as well, since the square-well potential is greater than the lennard-jones potential at λσ.
