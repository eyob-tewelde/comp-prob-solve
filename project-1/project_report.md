# Project 1: Comptetitive Adsorption Between Nitrogen and Hydrogen



## Introduction: The Haber-Bosch Process

Since the 1900s, the global human population has seen an incredible period of growth, increasing from 1.5 to 8 billion people. This exponetial growth is unprecedented in the context of human history and can be attributed to a variety of factors. One of the most significant, if not the most, developments in the last century that has enabled this growth is the Haber-Bosch process.

The Haber-Bosch process is the industrial procedure by which atmospheric nitrogen and gaseous hydrogen react using a metal catalyst at high pressures and temperatures. There are three proposed mechanisms for this catalysis reaction, each beginning with either a N2 or N molecule adsorbing to the catalyst surface. Since the process must begin with the adsorption of nitrogen, the overall reaction will be slowed down by hydrogen molecules that have adsorbed to the catalyst. These adsorbed hydrogens take up active reaction sites and prevent the synthesis of ammonia on that site until they have desorbed from the site. Therefore, the efficiency of the Haber-Bosch process depends on the competitive adsorption for active sites between nitrogen and hydrogen.

Since the competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface depends on the reaction conditions, the conditions can be optimized to promote nitrogen adsorption and thereby increase the efficiency of the overall process. In this report, the adsoption behavior of nitrogen and hydrogen on a 2D lattice surface as a function of chemical potential, interaction energies, and temperature is simulated and analyzed to broaden understanding of the competitive adsorption and determine the conditions that optimize nitrogen adsorption.
